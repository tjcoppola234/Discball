    \section{Introduction}

        Birthed by recent high school grads in the summer of covid (2020) this beautiful game is a fast and fun mixup of some of the highest velocity sports out there\ldots and it only exists because the lacrosse goals were left unlocked on the field. Turn to discball instead of ultimate frisbee when: 

        \begin{itemize}
            \item You don't have enough people for a full game
            \item You only have access to half of a football field
            \item You want to show people how accurate of a thrower you are
            \item You want to try something new
            \item Lacrosse goals are available
        \end{itemize}

        The game plays quick and you will most likely get gassed, but it will be worth it. It's a great way to learn how to curve your throws, throw at different heights, and work as a team. This is meant to be a simple guide to help interested players better understand the game. If a question is not addressed in this guide, make a pull request on github. All suggestions are welcome.

    \section{The Field}

        \includegraphics[width=.7\textwidth]{field/field}

        \vspace{5pt}

        Field Terms:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Crease}: The circle at the end of the field
            \item \textbf{Goal}: The lacrosse goal inside the crease, represented by a small rectangle.
            \item \textbf{Inner Box}: The rectangular space on the immediate front side of the crease.
            \item \textbf{Goal Line} The line in the Inner Box that runs through the crease.
            \item \textbf{Outer Box}: The area surrounding the Inner Box, but before the half-field line.
            \item \textbf{The Range}: The space past the half-field line. This area is the opponent's side of the field for a given team.
        \end{itemize}

    \section{Starting the game}

        \subsection{Making Teams}

        Teams should consist of 3 to 5 players each. A simple way to randomly pick teams is by having all players take turns flipping the disc. If the disc lands on its top, the player that flipped it joins the heads team. If the disc lands upside-down, the player that flipped it joins the tails team. When one team contains half of the overall amount of players, the players that haven't flipped yet go to the other team, so that both teams have the same number of players.

        \subsection{Beginning Play}
        There are multiple ways to start a game of discball. Pick the option that appeals to you most.
        
        \vspace{5pt}

        \subsubsection{Option 1: Pulling}
            \begin{enumerate}
                \item Flip a disc and determine the team that will start on offense
                \item Each team lines up on their goal line, facing the other side of the field
                \item Once both teams signal that they are ready (raising a hand in the air) one player from the team on defense pulls (throws) the disc to the other team. Pulls essentially work the same as in ultimate frisbee. Any additional rules for pulling specified in ultimate apply to discball when choosing this option. The throwing player is called the \textbf{puller}
                \item As soon as the disc leaves possession of the puller, all players can go past the goal line.
                \item The team that received the pull in the first half will be the team that pulls the disc in the second half.
            \end{enumerate}

        \subsubsection{Option 2: Jump disc}
            \begin{enumerate}
                \item Two players, one from each team, stand next to each other at the middle of the half-field line. They are called the \textbf{headers}
                \item One player from a random team stands on the sidelines at the half-field line. They are called the \textbf{setter}.
                \item The setter tosses the frisbee above the headers, as close as possible to evenly between them. If one of the headers feels that the throw is not even enough or it favors one side over the other, the headers can reset and the setter makes another attempt. If a bad throw occurs three times, the setter is replaced by another player on the same team.
                \item The headers jump up and attempt to grab the disc. The team of the header that gets the disc is on offense, and the other team is on defense. As soon as a header gains possession of the disc, all players can leave the goal line. If the disc hits the ground, the team on the side of the field that the disc lands on gains possession and is on offense.
                \item The team that did not set the disc in the first half will be the team that sets the disc in the second half
            \end{enumerate}

        \subsubsection{Option 3: Shootout}
            \begin{enumerate}
                \item Flip a disc and determine the team that will shoot first.
                \item Players line up on the sidelines at the half-field line. A single-file line forms, with each spot in the line alternating between players from different teams. A player from the team that wins the disc flip goes to the front of the line.
                \item The player at the front of the line goes to the middle of the field and attempts to score a goal. If they are successful, their team is on offense. If they do not score, that player retrieves the disc and throws it to the next player in line. Then the next player in line makes the same attempt and the first player goes to the end of the line. 
                \item The line continues to shift and players continue to throw at the goal until a player scores. The team of the player that scores is on offense and the other team is on defense.
                \item As soon as a player scores a goal, the team on defense must go to their half of the field, while the team on offense retrieves the disc and may go anywhere on the field.
            \end{enumerate}

        \end{figure}

    \section{Penalties}

        Players call the penalties. If a player thinks a foul occured, they call it out and play stops. If the offending player agrees that a foul occured, then play resets and 
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item If the fouled player was handling the disc, they retain possession at the their current position.
            \item If the fouled player was receiving a pass, the original handler retains possession at the point of the throw.
            \item If the fouled player was defending against a pass, a turnover occurs at the position where the foul occured.
            \item If the fouled player was marking the handler, a turnover occurs at that position.
        \end{enumerate}

        \subsection{Other penalties}
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Defensive and offensive players are not allowed in the crease. 
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item If an offensive player steps into the crease, a turnover occurs at the position of the handler.
                    \item If a defensive player steps into the crease, they must go behind the goal and do a pushup, then they can return to play.
                \end{itemize}
                Players are allowed to jump across the crease, but they must quickly leave the crease if they land in it.
                \item If all but one defensive players are not behind the half-field line on the side of the field opposite the offense when the disc is checked, the offensive checker retains possession of the disc at the middle of the field, in front of the half-field line.
            \end{itemize}
